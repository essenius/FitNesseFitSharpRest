Set some configuration parameters for the REST queries we want to make.
We are going to be using Json.

!|table:Rest Config                 |
|DefaultAccept     |application/json|
|DefaultContentType|application/json|
|DefaultUserAgent  |FitNesseRest    |
|Encoding          |utf-8           |
|Headers                            |!-header1:value1
header2:value2-!|
|ContentTypeMapping|!-application/xml:XML
application/json:JSON
text/plain:TEXT
default:JSON-!|
|Cookies|!-cookie1=value1
cookie2=value2-!|

Post some data to a test service, and capture its response into a JSon object. Also show some response headers and the request body (handy for debugging)
The first show statement should cause an exception as you can only inspect cookies after a request was sent.

!|script           |RestTester                  |https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/|
|Set Request Body  |{"title": "Test Data", "body": "Test Body", "userId":96 }         |
|show              |property                    |bogus   |of cookie       |bogus      |
|set request header|Content-Type                |to      |application/json; foo=2     |
|Send              |POST                        |to      |posts                       |
|check             |response code               |201                                  |
|$id=              |value from response matching|id                                   |

|script                                                                              |
|show |response                                                                      |
|show |response headers        |[Content-Length, Content-Type]                       |
|show |response headers without|[Content-Length]                                     |

Several of these property inquiries should cause an exception because something is wrong with them

!|script|
|show |cookies                                                                       |
|check|property                |Path  |of cookie|cookie1|/                           |
|check|property                |Domain|of cookie|cookie2|jsonplaceholder.typicode.com|
|check|property                |bogus |of cookie|cookie1|irrelevant                  |
|check|property                |path  |of cookie|cookie3|irrelevant                  |
|check|property                |      |of cookie|       |irrelevant                  |
|check|request headers         |=~/foo=2/                                            |

|script                                                                    |
|show  |request headers  without  |[Authorization]                         |
|show  |value from request header |Accept        |matching|application/(.+)|
|$size=|value from response header|Content-Length|matching|(\d+)           |
|show  |request body                                                       |

Delete an object, which should (pretend to) work

!|script                                  |
|Send|DELETE|to|/posts/$id|expect code|200|

We have the ability to show a few headers, all the headers, or all except some.
We can also use regular expressions (regex) to parse response values.

!|script                                                                 |
|show  |Request Headers without   |[Authorization]                       |
|show  |request headers           |[Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length]|
|$size=|value from response header|Content-Length   |matching   |(\d+)   |
|check |response                  |                                      |

|Script                        |
|show|response code            |
|show|response code description|

Let's get a list of all the users that are stored in the test service.
The response is a Json array, so we use the default property name _

!|script                                 |
|Send      |GET|to|/users|expect code|200|
|$response=|Response Object              |
|show      |response                     |

|table: properties for object|$response|_[0].address|

A Put command updates an existing element. Do that, and then check if the element was indeed (pretended to be) updated.

!|script                                                                      |
|$body=|echo                        |New Body Text                            |
|Send  |Put                         |to  |/posts/1|with Body|{ "body":"$body"}|
|check |response code               |200                                      |
|check |value from response matching|body|$body                               |

#HEAD is not supported by this server, so check if it returns the right error

#!|script                                                       |
#|set request body|                                             |
#|Send            |HEAD|to|/RestService.svc/Data|expect code|404|
